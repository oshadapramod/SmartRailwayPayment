# Frontend Application

This directory contains the frontend part of the fullstack application, built using React.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend application with:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files for the application.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.js`: The main React component that defines the structure and logic of the UI.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application that renders the `App` component into the DOM.
