# Fullstack Application

This project is a fullstack application that consists of a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with React. The backend and frontend are developed separately, allowing for modular development and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
